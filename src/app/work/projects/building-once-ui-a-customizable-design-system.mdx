## Overview

As a Fullstack Developer at TrueColor, I developed and maintained the cloud infrastructure for our machine learning API service. The system was built using Google Cloud Platform services, particularly Cloud Run for containerized applications, integrated with Cloudflare for DNS management and security.

## Technical Architecture

### Cloud Infrastructure Components
- **Google Cloud Run**
  - Containerized FastAPI application deployment
  - Automatic scaling based on traffic
  - Pay-per-use pricing model
  - Zero server management overhead

- **Google Cloud Storage**
  - Secure storage for ML models
  - Image and data storage
  - Backup management
  - Version control for ML models

- **Security Implementation**
  - Cloud Firewall rules configuration
  - SSL/TLS encryption
  - API authentication system
  - Rate limiting implementation

- **Cloudflare Integration**
  - DNS management
  - DDoS protection
  - CDN configuration
  - SSL certificate management

## API Development

### FastAPI Implementation
- Built RESTful API endpoints for ML model interaction
- Implemented async operations for improved performance
- Created comprehensive API documentation using Swagger
- Developed request validation and error handling

### Machine Learning Integration
- Created endpoints for ML model inference
- Implemented model version management
- Built caching system for frequent predictions
- Optimized API response times for ML operations

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework**:
  - Python 3.9+
  - FastAPI
  - Pydantic for data validation
  - Uvicorn ASGI server

- **Cloud Services**:
  - Google Cloud Run
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - Google Cloud Firewall
  - Cloudflare DNS

- **Development Tools**:
  - Docker
  - Git
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
  - Postman for API testing

## Performance Optimizations

- Implemented caching strategies for frequent requests
- Optimized container configurations
- Set up auto-scaling policies
- Configured Cloudflare caching rules

## Security Measures

- Implemented API key authentication
- Set up firewall rules
- Configured CORS policies
- Implemented rate limiting
- Set up security headers

## Monitoring and Logging

- Set up Cloud Monitoring
- Implemented structured logging
- Created alert policies
- Built performance dashboards

## Key Achievements

- Achieved 99.9% uptime for API services
- Reduced API response time to under 100ms
- Successfully handled peak loads of 1000+ requests/minute
- Maintained secure and efficient ML model deployment
- Optimized cloud costs while maintaining performance

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implemented efficient caching strategies
   - Optimized Docker container configurations
   - Fine-tuned Cloud Run instances

2. **Security Implementation**:
   - Set up comprehensive firewall rules
   - Implemented robust authentication system
   - Configured Cloudflare security features

3. **Cost Management**:
   - Optimized Cloud Run instance usage
   - Implemented efficient storage strategies
   - Set up cost monitoring and alerts
